### What Makes These Templates ATS-Friendly?

1. **Single-Column Format**
   - ATS systems read left-to-right, top-to-bottom

   ```html
   <header> → Name and contact
   <section> → Each major resume section
   <h1> → Your name
   <h2> → Section titles
   <h3> → Job titles
   <article> → Individual experiences
   ```

4. **Font Selection**
   - **Body Text:** 10-12pt
   - **Headings:** 14-16pt
   - **Fonts:** Arial, Calibri, Georgia (universally recognized)

5. **No ATS-Breaking Elements**
   - ❌ No headers/footers for critical info
   - ❌ No text boxes or columns
   - ❌ No images, charts, or graphics

/* Adjust if needed, but stay within ATS-safe ranges:

```

### Adding/Removing Sections

1. Find the section to modify:

    </div>
</section>
```

2. Copy entire `<section>` block to duplicate
3. Delete entire `<section>` block to remove
4. Maintain consistent spacing with other sections

### Modifying Content Length

**If content is too long:**

**If content is too short:**

## 📚 Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

1. **Use Action Verbs**
   - ✅ "Increased revenue by 145%"
   - ❌ "Was responsible for revenue"

   Examples: Achieved, Built, Created, Developed, Engineered, Implemented, Led, Managed, Optimized, Spearheaded

2. **Quantify Everything**
   - Include numbers, percentages, dollar amounts
   - Before/after metrics show impact
   - User counts, team sizes, budget amounts
   - Time savings, efficiency gains

3. **Keyword Optimization**
   - Mirror job description language
   - Include industry-standard terms
   - Mention key skills 2-3 times naturally
   - Use both acronyms and full terms (e.g., "SEO" and "Search Engine Optimization")

4. **Tailor for Each Application**
   - Adjust summary to match job requirements
   - Reorder skills based on job posting
   - Highlight most relevant experiences
   - Remove irrelevant information

### Formatting Guidelines

1. **Consistency is Key**

   - Consistent bullet point style
   - Uniform spacing between sections
   - Matching font weights and sizes

2. **White Space Matters**
   - Don't overcrowd the page
   - Leave breathing room around sections
   - Use line breaks strategically
   - Aim for 60-70% text coverage

3. **Bullet Points**
   - 3-6 bullets per position
   - Each bullet should be 1-2 lines
   - Most important accomplishments first
   - Start each with strong action verb

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Which template should I use?**
A: Choose based on your industry and career level. See the [Template Collection](#template-collection) table for guidance.

**Q: Can I use these for any country?**
A: These are optimized for US/Canada job markets. For international applications, you may need to adjust format (e.g., CV vs Resume, date formats, etc.).

**Q: Are these really ATS-friendly?**
A: Yes! They follow all 2025 ATS best practices from Jobscan, Resume.io, and other leading resume experts. Single-column layout, standard fonts, semantic HTML, and keyword optimization.

**Q: How do I know if my resume will pass ATS?**
A: Use free ATS scanners like Jobscan.co or Resume Worded to test your resume against specific job descriptions.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Do I need to know HTML to use these?**
A: No! You can edit them in any text editor. Just replace the sample text with your information while keeping the HTML tags intact.

**Q: Can I convert these to Word format?**
A: Yes, export to PDF first, then use an online PDF-to-Word converter. However, PDF is generally preferred for applications.

**Q: Will the colors affect ATS parsing?**
A: No! The colors are for visual presentation only. ATS systems parse the text content, which is all in standard HTML.

**Q: How do I add a photo?**
A: We don't recommend adding photos for US applications as they can cause ATS issues and potential bias. If required for international applications, consult an HTML tutorial for image embedding.

### Customization Questions

**Q: Can I change the layout to two columns?**
A: Not recommended! Two-column layouts confuse ATS systems. Stick with single-column for best results.

**Q: Can I add tables or charts?**
A: Avoid tables and charts as they're not ATS-friendly. Use bullet points and text to convey information.

**Q: How do I fit everything on one page?**
A: Reduce font size slightly (min 10pt), tighten spacing, or remove less relevant content. For experienced professionals, 2 pages is acceptable.

**Q: Can I use different fonts?**
A: Stick with Arial, Calibri, or Georgia for ATS compatibility. Other fonts may not parse correctly.
